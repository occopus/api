Common functions of a generic OCCO app.

Author: Adam Visegradi <adam.visegradi@sztaki.mta.hu>

This module can be used to implement OCCO-based applications in a unified way.
The module provides features for command-line and file based configuration of
an OCCO application, and other generic features.

There are *two* ways to build an OCCO application.

1. The components provided by OCCO can be used as simple librares: they can be
   imported and glued together with specialized code, a script.

2. The other way is to use this module as the core of such an application. This
   module can build an OCCO architecture based on the contents of a YAML config
   file. (Utilizing the highly dynamic nature of YAML compared to other markup
   languages.)

The :func:`setup` function expects a config file either through its
``cfg_path`` parameter, or it will try to get the path from the command line,
or it will try some default paths (see :func:`occo.util.config.config` for
specifics). See the documentation of :func:`setup` for details.

"""

args = None
"""Arguments parsed by argparse or an :mod:`occo.util.config` class."""

configuration = None
"""Configuration data loaded from the file(s) specified with ``--cfg``."""

"""The OCCO infrastructure defined in the configuration."""

def setup(setup_args=None, cfg_path=None, auth_data_path=None):
    """
    Build an OCCO application from configuration.

    :param function setup_args: A function that accepts an
        :class:`argparse.ArgumentParser` object. This function can set up the
        argument parser as needed (mainly: add command line arguments).
    :param str cfg_path: Optional. The path of the configuration file. If
        unspecified, other sources will be used (see
        :func:`occo.util.config.config` for details).

    **OCCO Configuration**

    OCCO uses YAML as a configuration language, mainly for its dynamic
    properties, and its human readability. The parsed configuration is a
    dictionary, containing both static parameters and objects already
    instantiated (or executed, sometimes!) by the YAML parser.

    The configuration must contain the following items.

        ``logging``

            The :mod:`logging` configuration dictionary that will be used with
            :func:`logging.config.dictConfig` to setup logging.
        
        ``components``

            The components of the OCCO architecture that's need to be built.

                ``resourcehandler``

                    *The* ``ResourceHandler`` instance (singleton) to be used by
                    other components (e.g. the
                    :class:`~occo.infraprocessor.InfraProcessor`. Multiple
                    backends can be supported by using a basic
                    :class:`occo.resourcehandler.ResourceHandler` instance here
                    configured with multiple backend clouds/resources.

                ``configmanager``

                    *The* ``ConfigManager`` instance (singleton) to be used
                    by other components (e.g. the
                    :class:`~occo.infraprocessor.InfraProcessor`. Multiple
                    backends can be supported by using a basic
                    :class:`occo.resourcehandler.ConfigManager` instance here
                    configured with multiple backend service composers [#f1]_.

                ``uds``

                    The storage used by this OCCO application.

    .. [#f1] This feature is not yet implemented at the time of writing.

    .. todo:: Change conditionals and scattered error handling in this function
        to preliminary schema-checking (when the schema has been finalized).
